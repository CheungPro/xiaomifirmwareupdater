title: Announcing a new download page for MIUI 11 China Beta
categories: roms

Many of you know already that global beta is no longer available, and China beta is still released but Xiaomi is no longer providing download links on their official website.

I've been collecting the links every week in order to provide weekly firmware updates for custom roms users through my XiaomiFirmwareUpdater project, and I decided to make these links available for everyone.

The download page on my XiaomiFirmwareUpdater website has all MIUI 11 China Beta official roms starting from October 2019 for 30+ device. I'll keep it updated with newer releases every week.
